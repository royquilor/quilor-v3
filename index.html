              Roy is a very nice, very accomplished UX/UI designer who delivers spot on work. In my time working with him, our company saw him as a key contributor to the development of our products, and as a high value, trusted member of the client services team. He has an enviable eye for detail and the ability to really focus on the end user at every stage along a journey: leading to truly valuable work.

              Roy is an awesome designer who loves simplicity, typography and useful products. Having worked alongside Roy for 3 years I know that he's really dedicated to his work and a great guy to have on your team. I'd fully recommend Roy for any web and mobile app design projects!

              Roy created our website from start to finish and did a fantastic job on the creation, styling and usability as well as keeping it orientated around user experience and ultimately conversion goals. Would happily work with Roy again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend him.

              Roy is a good designer who can prototype his own designs and can iterate quickly when working to a tight deadline. He worked well with developers, designers, project managers and clients. A pleasure and honour to work with for 5 years.
